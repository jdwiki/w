      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>Every site has its legal Terms of Use. The bottom of this page contains our &ldquo;Terms of Use Agreement&rdquo;. Before you read it, you might want to first review our plain English guidelines to the WikiOD community:</p>
<h2 id="a-civil-group-effort">A civil group effort <a href="#a-civil-group-effort" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>WikiOD is a group effort to create a great resource: free how-to-program tutorials. You must expect your writing to be modified, criticized constructively, or improved by others. Changes should be viewed in the spirit of improvement and not as a criticism of your approach or capabilities. On the other hand, when editing someone else&rsquo;s work, always be friendly, civil, and supportive. Never make any personal attacks. Assume good faith in everyone&rsquo;s efforts. Remember that WikiOD contributors volunteer to help build this great resource, so please be nice to them. When you disagree with another WikiOD community member please stay cool and talk things over civilly. Writers and editors who can&rsquo;t cooperate and work for the best interest of the group will be discouraged or prevented from participating.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-instructions">Helpful instructions <a href="#helpful-instructions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>WikiOD tutorials should help people solve their programming problems. We believe that profanity, adult content, hate-based, recreational drug-focused, joke topics, societal instructions, and vanity pages are inappropriate for WikiOD. Topics that cause virus, crash or universally illegal will also be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="limit-egregious-self-advertising">Limit egregious self-advertising <a href="#limit-egregious-self-advertising" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>WikiOD exists to help people, not for product promotion. While we encourage useful tutorials about how to code and make login page, writers should refrain from creating articles to purely promote one specific business without providing useful insights to our readers. While you are welcome to post an external hyperlink, the WikiOD community reserves the right to delete hyperlinks or entire tutorials that overstep the bounds on self-advertising.</p>
<h2 id="creative-commons-licensed">Creative Commons Licensed <a href="#creative-commons-licensed" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>WikiOD licenses its text under a Creative Commons License. The license allows WikiOD content to be used freely for any purposes. Allowing free republication of our content helps achieve WikiOD&rsquo;s mission by offering our instructions to the problems of everyday life to even more people for free. In addition, our license allows for the creation of derivative works under the same license. The ability to make derivative works enables the future creation of others and creates a &ldquo;right to fork&rdquo; which essentially guarantees that the WikiOD project will always be free and community controlled.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading these site guidelines. Here are WikiOD&rsquo;s Terms of Use:</p>
<h2 id="terms-of-use-agreement">Terms of Use Agreement <a href="#terms-of-use-agreement" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
