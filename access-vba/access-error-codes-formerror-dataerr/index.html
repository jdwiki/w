<p>Here is typical error handler for a subform as a table:</p>
<pre><code>Public Const cErrCodeValueRequierd = 3162
Public Const cErrCodeDuplicateKey = 3022

Private Sub Form_Error(DataErr As Integer, Response As Integer)
    Select Case DataErr
        Case cErrCodeDuplicateKey
            MsgBox &quot;Duplicate records are not allowed!&quot;, vbExclamation, &quot;Key violation&quot;
            Response = acDataErrContinue
        Case cErrCodeValueRequired
            MsgBox &quot;Field &quot;&quot;fieldName&quot;&quot; requires data!&quot;&quot;
            Response = acDataErrContinue
        Case Else
            MsgBox &quot;Other error. Error code: &quot; &amp; DataErr

End Sub

<p>Basic error handling should be added to all procedures in production code, since otherwise an unexpected error will cause Access to crash or invite the end-user to enter debug mode.</p>
<p>A typical pattern for a basic error handler that traps all errors is:</p>
<!-- language: lang-vb -->
<pre><code>Sub Name()
On Error GoTo errHandler

'[some code...]

exitHandler:
    'Clean up any objects
    Exit Sub

errHandler:
    Select Case Err.Number
        'Any expected error cases go here
    Case Else
        MsgBox Err.Number &amp; Err.Description
    End Select
    Resume exitHandler   'Make sure objects get cleaned up when code threw an error
End Sub
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Public Const cErrCodeNotNumber = 2262   ' This value must be a number.
