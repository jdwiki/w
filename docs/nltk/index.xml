      <description>NLTK&amp;rsquo;s download function # You can install NLTK over pip (pip install nltk).After it is installed, many components will not be present, and you will not be able to use some of NLTK&amp;rsquo;s features.
From your Python shell, run the function ntlk.download() to select which additional packages you want to install using UI. Alternatively, you can use python -m nltk.downloader [package_name].
To download all packages available.
nltk.download(&amp;lsquo;all&amp;rsquo;)

      <description>This topic focuses on the use of the nltk.FreqDist() class.
Frequency Distribution to Count the Most Common Lexical Categories # NLTK provides the FreqDist class that let&amp;rsquo;s us easily calculate a frequency distribution given a list as input.
Here we are using a list of part of speech tags (POS tags) to see which lexical categories are used the most in the brown corpus.
import nltk brown_tagged = nltk.corpus.brown.tagged_words() pos_tags = [pos_tag for _,pos_tag in brown_tagged] fd = nltk.</description>

      <title>Stop Words</title>

      <description>Stop words are the words which are mostly used as fillers and hardly have any useful meaning. We should avoid these words from taking up space in database or taking up valuable processing time. We can easily make a list of words to be used as stop words and then filter these words from the data we want to process.
Filtering out stop words # NLTK has by default a bunch of words that it considers to be stop words.</description>

      <title>POS Tagging</title>

      <description>Part of speech tagging creates tuples of words and parts of speech. It labels words in a sentence as nouns, adjectives, verbs,etc. It can also label by tense, and more. These tags mean whatever they meant in your original training data. You are free to invent your own tags in your training data, as long as you are consistent in their usage. Training data generally takes a lot of work to create, so a pre-existing corpus is typically used.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing</title>

      <description>It refers to the splitting of sentences and words from the body of text into sentence tokens or word tokens respectively. It is an essential part of NLP, as many modules work better (or only) with tags. For example, pos_tag needs tags as input and not the words, to tag them by parts of speech.
Sentence and word tokenization from user given paragraph # from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize example_text = input(&amp;quot;Enter the text: &amp;quot;) print(&amp;quot;Sentence Tokens:&amp;quot;) print(sent_tokenize(example_text)) print(&amp;quot;Word Tokens:&amp;quot;) print(word_tokenize(example_text)) </description>

      <title>Stemming</title>

      <description>Stemming is a sort of normalizing method. Many variations of words carry the same meaning, other than when tense is involved. The reason why we stem is to shorten the lookup, and normalize sentences. Basically, it is finding the root of words after removing verb and tense part from it. One of the most popular stemming algorithms is the Porter stemmer, which has been around since 1979.
