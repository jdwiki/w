      <description>Installing Elasticsearch on Windows # Prerequisites # The Windows version of Elasticsearch can be obtained from this link: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch. The latest stable release is always at the top.
As we are installing on Windows, we need the .ZIP archive. Click the link in the Downloads: section and save the file to your computer.
This version of elastic is &amp;ldquo;portable&amp;rdquo;, meaning you don&amp;rsquo;t need to run an installer to use the program.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch Configuration </title>

      <description>Elasticsearch comes with a set of defaults that provide a good out of the box experience for development. The implicit statement there is that it is not necessarily great for production, which must be tailored for your own needs and therefore cannot be predicted.
The default settings make it easy to download and run multiple nodes on the same machine without any configuration changes.
Where are the settings? # Inside each installation of Elasticsearch is a config/elasticsearch.</description>

      <description>Syntax # curl -X&amp;lt;VERB&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt;PROTOCOL&amp;gt;://&amp;lt;HOST&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;PORT&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;PATH&amp;gt;?&amp;lt;QUERY_STRING&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo; -d &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;&amp;rsquo;
Where:
VERB: The appropriate HTTP method or verb: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, or DELETE
PROTOCOL: Either http or https (if you have an https proxy in front of Elasticsearch.)
HOST: The hostname of any node in your Elasticsearch cluster, or localhost for a node on your local machine.
PORT: The port running the Elasticsearch HTTP service, which defaults to 9200.
PATH: API Endpoint (for example _count will return the number of documents in the cluster).</description>

      <title>Difference Between Indices and Types</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/elasticsearch/difference-between-indices-and-types/</link>

      <guid>https://www.wikiod.com/elasticsearch/difference-between-indices-and-types/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see types like a table in an SQL database, where the index is the SQL database. However, that is not a good way to approach types.
All About Types # In fact, types are literally just a metadata field added to each document by Elasticsearch: _type. The examples above created two types: my_type and my_other_type. That means that each document associated with the types has an extra field automatically defined like &amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my_type&amp;quot;; this is indexed with the document, thus making it a searchable or filterable field, but it does not impact the raw document itself, so your application does not need to worry about it.</description>

      <description>Cluster Health provides a lot of information about the cluster, such as the number of shards that are allocated (&amp;ldquo;active&amp;rdquo;) as well as how many are unassigned and relocating. In addition, it provides the current number of nodes and data nodes in the cluster, which can allow you to poll for missing nodes (e.g., if you expect it to be 15, but it only shows 14, then you are missing a node).</description>

      <title>Search API</title>

      <description>The search API allows you to execute a search query and get back search hits that match the query. The query can either be provided using a simple query string as a parameter, or using a request body.
Search using request body # Searches can also be done on elasticsearch using a search DSL.The query element within the search request body allows to define a query using the Query DSL.</description>

      <description>Analyzers take the text from a string field and generate tokens that will be used when querying.
An Analyzer operates in a sequence:
CharFilters (Zero or more) Tokenizer (One) TokenFilters (Zero or more) The analyzer may be applied to mappings so that when fields are indexed, it is done on a per token basis rather than on the string as a whole. When querying, the input string will also be run through the Analyzer.</description>

      <title>Difference Between Relational Databases and Elasticsearch</title>

      <description>This is for the readers who come from relational background and want to learn elasticsearch. This topic shows the use cases for which Relational databases are not a suitable option.
Terminology Difference # Relational Database Elasticsearch Database Index Table Type Row/Record Document Column Name field Above table roughly draws an analogy between basic elements of relational database and elasticsearch.
Setup
Considering Following structure in a relational database:
create databse test; use test; create table product; create table product (name varchar, id int PRIMARY KEY); insert into product (id,name) VALUES (1,&#39;Shirt&#39;); insert into product (id,name) VALUES (2,&#39;Red Shirt&#39;); select * from product; name | id ----------+---- Shirt | 1 Red Shirt | 2 Elasticsearch Equivalent:</description>

      <description>Kibana is front end data visualization tool for elasticsearch. for installing kibana refer to the kibana documentation. For running kibana on localhost go to https://localhost:5601 and go to kibana console.
Explore your Cluster using Kibana # The command syntax will be of the following type:
&amp;lt;REST Verb&amp;gt; /&amp;lt;Index&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;ID&amp;gt; Execute the following command to explore elasticsearch cluster through Kibana Console.
For checking the cluster health
GET /_cat/health?v
For listing all the indices</description>
