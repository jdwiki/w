      <description>Installation or Setup # Detailed instructions on getting django-views set up or installed.
Django Views # Django Views are simply the functions that get called when a request is made to a certain URLs.
URL patterns are written in urls.py file, each URL regex is given a function(Django view) from a views.py, so when a request is made, that function gets the call, with the HTTP request object, and then you can do whatever fun you want to do with that request.</description>
