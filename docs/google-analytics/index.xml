      <description>What is Data processing latency? # When a hit is sent to Google Analytics the data must be processed. Processing latency is 24-48 hours. This means that it can take time before you will see data under standard reports (Not real-time) any data that you do see may not be correct as it has probably not completed processing.
Standard accounts that send more than 200,000 sessions per day to Analytics will result in the reports being refreshed only once a day.</description>

Event Tracking will allow you to see JS errors in real-time. Under Real Time -&amp;gt; Events sections.
Unfortunately, your error messages will be limited by 500 Bytes, so you will not be able to understand a problem properly, however you will know that something is going wrong.
Exception Tracking will give you more detailed report, with full error message and browser information.</description>

      <description>Parameters # Parameter Details sampleRate Float number describing the amount of users in percent to be tracked. Default = 100. Sampling in Analytics is the practice of selecting a subset of data from your traffic and reporting on the trends available in that sample set. Sampling is widely used in statistical analysis because analyzing a subset of data gives similar results to analyzing all of the data. In addition, sampling speeds up processing for reports when the volume of data is so large as to slow down report queries.</description>
