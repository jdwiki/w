      <description>Installation # Ember-cli first requires Node and NPM to be installed on the system. Either follow the installation instructions on nodejs.org, or use a preferred package manager (such as Homebrew on OSX.) It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to install latest version of each.
Once its done, run the following commands to ensure installation was correct:
node -v npm -v Since Yarn package manager has been released recently (October 2016), it&amp;rsquo;s possible to install dependencies with Yarn instead of NPM.</description>

      <description>Syntax # Ember g [blueprints.eg: route] [name] &amp;ndash;pod Ember g route foo &amp;ndash;pod Ember g component my-name &amp;ndash;pod Parameters # Generate pods g &amp;ndash;pod Just pass --pod to ember generate when generating new files.
If you would like to use the pods structure as the default for your project, you can set usePods in your .ember-cli config file to true (setting was previously named usePodsByDefault). To generate or destroy a blueprint in the classic type structure while usePods is true, use the --classic flag.</description>
