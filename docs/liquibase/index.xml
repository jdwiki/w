      <description>If you want to use the &amp;lt;includeAll&amp;gt; tag in your changelog and expect it to find the relative changelog through the classloader of your wildfly application server, you may hit some issue as the Virtual file system wildfly uses produces URLs that are not properly processed by the ClassLoaderResourceAccessor bundled with Liquibase.
Workaround classloader for wildfly # As a workaround, you may use the wildfly-specific VFS api and write your own ResourceAcessor implementation, such as this one below.</description>
