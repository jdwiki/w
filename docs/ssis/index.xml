      <description>Using loop control to run a dataflow task for every file. # If you want to check the existence of one file or do a couple of actions for every file in a folder you can use the Foreach Loop Container.
You give the path and the file mask and it will run it for every file it finds
Steps to check if a file exist or not # To complete this objective following tasks are required.</description>

      <description>Using Built in conversion # Using Derived column we can prepare the input. We will provide yyyy-MM-dd to the final conversion:
Year: (DT_STR,4,1252)(DataDate / 10000) Month: (DT_STR,2,1252)(DataDate / 100 % 100) Day: (DT_STR,2,1252)(DataDate % 100) All together: (DT_DBDATE)((DT_STR,4,1252)(DataDate / 10000) + &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; + (DT_STR,2,1252)(DataDate / 100 % 100) + &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; + (DT_STR,2,1252)(DataDate % 100))
This is a faster solution than a scripting components, but less readable.

      <description>File System Tasks in SSIS # From the Control Flow tab in your SSIS package, look in the SSIS Toolbox in the common section for the File System Task, drag this onto your design surface where you want the file move to happen in your package.
Once you&amp;rsquo;ve placed the task, double click to open it.
From here you&amp;rsquo;ll want to first give the task a name. This helps later when you&amp;rsquo;re reading logs looking for errors, you can recognize your file move task by name in those logs.</description>

      <description>The guide helps in understanding how to import data from the SQL server table to a CSV/txt file.
Right click on the Data Flow Task and select property. DefaultBufferMaxRows and DefaultBufferSize properties can be changed to improve data load performance. Multiple Data Flow Task can be executed in parallel for better performance. Each Task has two flows success and failure. It is important to handle the failure flow to make the package more robust.</description>

      <description>Using Sort and Conditional Split components # Since you need to sort &amp;amp; rename the fields, the best option will be the Sort Component in the Data Flow task (like you mentioned) . If you only want to rename columns, then use the &amp;ldquo;Derived Column&amp;rdquo; component. The Sort component should look as follows: In my example, you can see the LastName, FirstName &amp;amp; BirthDate are sorted and LastName &amp;amp; BirthDate are renamed.</description>
