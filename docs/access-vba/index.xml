      <description>The most tricky part is finding description for error codes. This site has a most complete list of codes I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far.

      <title>EnableDisable Shift Key on DB Open</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/access-vba/enabledisable-shift-key-on-db-open/</link>

      <description>This code will turn off the capability for a user to hold down the Shift key when opening a database to skip the default form opening and allow the user access to the Navigation Pane and VB Editor. In DBâ€™s that you do not want users to have access to either of these (along with disabling the use of Special Keys in the Current Database Options), this code will help to keep the database locked down.</description>

      <title>Check if Table Exists in Current DB</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/access-vba/check-if-table-exists-in-current-db/</link>

      <description>Simply place this code as a Public Module that can be called by any other procedure. When calling the code, add in the name of the table you want to look up within the parenthesis. The Code returns a True/False value on whether or not a table already exists. This is helpful when needing to determine if a table needs to be deleted/purged or if a table already exists before performing additional code.</description>

      <title>Create Text Delimited File in Access Vba</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/access-vba/create-text-delimited-file-in-access-vba/</link>

      <description>Some times you may need to create a delimited text file for various uses. The following example is one of many ways to help you do that. I have used a pipe (&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;) for my delimiter, to change that just change the assignment of the Sep variable. In my example I dump the recordset to an array, this is by no means the defacto approach, its just my go to. This can easily be done using the recordset itself as well.</description>
