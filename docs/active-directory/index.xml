      <description>One thing you might consider with any domains in your forest is how many physical vs virtual machines you want to have. Personally I believe that there should be one physical machine per domain. One of the reasons I believe this is because of how the clocks are handled on, specifically in my case, Hyper-V machines. I cannot speak to VMWare. On a Hyper-V host it installs a clock sync service on the guest operating systems.</description>
