      <description>Installation or Setup # XHTML Relation to HTML
XHTML is simply the serialized version of HTML. XHTML was originally intended to clean up HTML markup to better improve standards support. Unfortunately the W3C&amp;rsquo;s work on XHTML 2.0 was not intuitive and detracted from where the industry as a whole was headed with HTML5. XHTML5 is not a standard though you can use XHTML5 (XML serialized HTML5) with minor modifications. Examples are provided below to ease the adoption of XHTML5 and clarify ambiguities in the HTML5 standard where XML is not taken in to consideration.</description>
