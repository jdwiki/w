      <description>Hello World with React and React Router # Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed react and react-router, Its time to use both of them together.
The syntax is very simple, you specify the url and the component you want to render when that url is opened
&amp;lt;Route path=&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; component={ HelloComponent } /&amp;gt;
This means when the url path is hello, Render the component HelloComponent
FILENAME: app.js
&#39;use strict&#39;; import React from &#39;react&#39;; import { render } from &#39;react-dom&#39;; import { Router, browserHistory, Link } from &#39;react-router&#39;; // These are just demo components which render different text.</description>

      <description>Some samples of integrating TypeScript with react-router 4.x.
The goal is to preserve as much type safety as possible.
How to accomplish this with TypeScript is not obvious when following the projects documentation.
Routing with typed parameters # import * as React from &#39;react&#39;; import * as ReactDOM from &#39;react-dom&#39;; import { Route, BrowserRouter as Router, Link, match } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;; // define React components for multiple pages class Home extends React.</description>
