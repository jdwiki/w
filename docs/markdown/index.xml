      <description>Variations of Markdown with differing syntax are called &amp;ldquo;flavors.&amp;rdquo; Markdown flavors are listed at https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/wiki/Markdown-Flavors.
A Markdown flavor can be implemented in various programming languages and software applications. Libraries that implement a Markdown parser are listed at https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations and https://www.w3.org/community/markdown/wiki/MarkdownImplementations.
Several Markdown flavors, and the differences between them, are documented at http://flavoredmarkdown.com.
To test and compare Markdown code in many different flavors, and implementations of those flavors, you can use the online tool Babelmark.</description>

The syntax for images is the same as that for links, but with an exclamation mark ! in front of the text (which is used as alt-text).
Inline Images # In this type of image addition, the image URL is included at the location where the image will be displayed. If you need to add the same image several times, you must include its URL every time.</description>
