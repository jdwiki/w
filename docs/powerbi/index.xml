      <description>M and DAX are two building blocks of Power BI. They both are functional languages but they differ considerably and are used for very different purposes.
This page shows code samples for both languages and explains their purpose.

      <title>Edit Queries (data import)</title>

      <description>This technique can also be used for other data sources e.g. files, web services.
Note that when you do change these settings, you may have to specify Authentication/Credential details for the new source.
Preventing data source string duplication # By default, when data is imported to the PowerBI Desktop, each table or query stores data source details separately, even if they use the same data source.
This makes it tedious, for example, to change the source database of an entire PowerBI report - which requires changing each query source parameter individually.</description>

      <description>Filtering data by dynamic criteria # For example, we need to create two visualisations, &amp;ldquo;Before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;After&amp;rdquo;, and use dynamic filter for the date of the split.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say our query is called table.
Add an additional date table with possible dates of the split.
Add a slicer control with the table added in the previous step.
Include a measure of this form to the table:
IsBefore = IF((Max(&#39;table&#39;[Date])&amp;lt;Min(&#39;Date&#39;[Date])),1,0)
Add two visuals, filter first by IsBefore = 1 and second - by IsBefore = 0</description>
