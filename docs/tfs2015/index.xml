      <description>Requirements of Team Foundation Server 2015 # Team Foundation Server (TFS) can be installed in two basic infrastructure ways, Single Server Deployment and Multi-Server Deployment. The difference between these two deployments is where the Application Tier (TFS) and the Data Tier (MS SQL) reside.
It is considered best practice to install TFS in a Multi-Server Deployment.
Before you can install TFS 2015, you must make sure you have met the requirements for both hardware and software.</description>
