      <description>Installation or Setup # Detailed instructions on getting asynchronous set up or installed.
File Reading in Node js # var fs = require(&amp;quot;fs&amp;quot;); fs.readFileSync(‘abc.txt’,function(err,data){ //Reading File Synchronously if(!err) { console.log(data); } //else //console.log(err); }); console.log(&amp;quot;something else&amp;quot;); Here, the program was waiting while reading the file. It will not go further before completing the read operation, which is an example of blocking code. But ideally, we should proceed further while the program was reading the file and once it is done we should go back and process that.</description>
