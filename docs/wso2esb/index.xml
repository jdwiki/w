      <description>Separate log files for each proxy service # All proxy services events are logged in the wso2carbon log file (located in %CARBON_HOME%/repository/logs).
If you want, you can have separate log files for each proxy service. Keep in mind, though, that they will still be logged in wso2carbon log file as well.
To do so, you should change the log4j.properties file, located in the %CARBON_HOME%/repository/conf folder.
For logs rolling on time basis, add the following lines at the bottom of the log4j.</description>
