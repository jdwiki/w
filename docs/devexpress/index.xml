      <description>Hope the sample illustration above helps someone who struggled like me to make rows conditionally select, as default functionality of DevExpress selects all rows irrespective whether it has a &amp;lsquo;checkbox&amp;rsquo; or not (when you use either ASPxGridView1.SelectAllRowsOnPage() or ASPxGridView1.SelectRows(), because of the way &amp;lsquo;Checkbox&amp;rsquo; column is implemented). Though there are various examples on DevExpress support site, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spot a working sample or scenario that explains this requirement.
Sample illustration using ASP.</description>
