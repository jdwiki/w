      <description>Installation or Setup # SAP Crystal Reports can be installed as a standalone program or integrated into Visual Studio. (SAP Crystal Reports for Visual Studio) - Both of which require very little effort outside of the installation wizard.

      <description>Syntax # Shared NumberVar x; Shared StringVar y := &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo;; Shared variables allow values to be used at any point in the processing of the report. Similar to a global variable, the shared values can also be accessed by subreports. This allows for a more direct method of comparison and allows the developer to circumvent the strict nature of the top-to-bottom report evaluation.
A shared variable can be defined, set, or recalled in any valid formula field.</description>
