      <description>SQL Server includes a feature called delayed naming which means that in many cases you can deploy procedure and code that references objects that do not exist. It is also possible to drop or alter an object in such a way that any pieces of referencing code no longer run when called.
When you get either of theses two situations, you only know you have an issue when the code executes and fails.</description>
