      <description>Getting started with HTTPS # HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of HTTP protocol, most often used in connection with services where only the sender and receiver must know the message. It&amp;rsquo;s required if you handle credit card information, and will improve your rank on Google.
To enable HTTPS you need to check if your web host supports itâ€”if you don&amp;rsquo;t know you can ask their support for help and information about it.</description>
