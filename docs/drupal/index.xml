      <description>The Rules module is an engine which allows site administrators to automate actions to be conditionally executed, either programmatically or in response to predetermined events.
Rules can react to Rules Events occurring on a Drupal site, such as a user logging in. And it can perform customized follow-up Rules Actions, such as redirecting to a certain page, which are to be conditionally executed if some Rules Conditions are satisfied.
Resources # Video tutorials: Johan Falk did an amazing job in the early Drupal 7 days by creating an impressive set of tutorials to &amp;ldquo;Learn the Rules Framework&amp;rdquo; with a set of over 30 videos and related blogposts hosted at nodeone.</description>

      <description>A field formatter specifies the way a field is rendered in Drupal templates. The formatter used by each field can be configured in the Manage display tab associated with the entity type that you are configuring.
Fields can have different formatters depending on the view mode that is being displayed which allows you to control how a field is rendered in different parts of your website.
Some things are important to consider when implementing a Field Formatter.</description>
