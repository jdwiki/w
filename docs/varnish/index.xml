      <description>Use varnishstat to monitor the numeric metrics of a currently running Varnish instance. It&amp;rsquo;s location will differ based on your installation. Running varnishstat -1 will output all metrics in a simple grep-able format.
Other utilities are available for watching varnish current status and logging: varnishtop, varnishlog etc.
Client metrics - incoming traffic # Client metrics cover the traffic between the client and the Varnish cache.
sess_conn - Cumulative number of connections.</description>

      <title>Built-in VCL</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/varnish/built-in-vcl/</link>

      <description>The built-in VCL contains procedures that are included and run last by Varnish.
They can complement user defined VCL by providing logic that is appropriate for the majority of the sites. For example, skips cache for POST requests, and/or in presence of cookie or authorization headers.
If some of the built-in logic is not needed, a user can add return() call from a procedure where built-in VCL logic is not desirable.</description>

      <title>Building vmods</title>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to compile vmods if the binaries for them are already available for your platform. Both CentOS 6 and 7 can leverage COPR builds by Ingvar in order to install a collection of extra modules by Varnish Software: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ingvar/varnish51/
Compile and install a vmod # Installation of a vmod requires an installed version of Varnish Cache, including the development files. Requirements can be found in the Varnish documentation.</description>
