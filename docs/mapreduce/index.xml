      <description>Installation or Setup # Mapreduce is a part of Hadoop. So when Apache Hadoop (or any distribution of Hadoop is installed) MR is automatically installed.
MapReduce is the data processing framework over HDFS(Hadoop distributed file system). MR jobs maybe written using Java, python, Scala, R, etc.
What does mapreduce do and how? # Mapreduce is a programming model to do processing on (very) large amounts of data.
Traditional &amp;lsquo;HPC&amp;rsquo; (High Performance Computing) speeds up large calculations on relatively large amounts of data by creating a set of highly connected computers (using things like extremely quick networking, and quick access to shared storage, shared memory) to handle computing problems that usually require calculations to have access to each others data.</description>
