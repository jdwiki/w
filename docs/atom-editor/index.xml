      <description>What is Atom? # Atom is a hackable text editor created by GitHub and developed on top of the Electron desktop application platform.
This means it can be used as a text editor for basic programming up to a full-sized IDE. It is also extremely customisable, it provides thousands of community-made packages (syntax highlighting, improved UX, etc.) and themes to suit everyone&amp;rsquo;s needs. It is also available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</description>

      <description>Note, the icons used at the end of the Opening Files and Directories example are not part of Atom&amp;rsquo;s standard styling, but are the result of the file-icons styling package.
Interactive File Tree # In order to keep track of your projects&amp;rsquo; file structure, Atom, like many text editors and IDEs, uses a file tree model. These trees show the locations and names of your files and directory. To toggle the tree between visible and hidden, the keys Ctrl+\ may be used (âŒ˜+\ for Mac OS).</description>
