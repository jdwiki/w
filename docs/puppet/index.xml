      <description>What is puppet and why should I care? # Puppet is a configuration management solution. Users describe the desired state of a server or software and configuration management achieves this state. This brings following advantages:
Configurations can be reproduced exactly the same every time, as many times as necessary Configurations for all software and servers are stored in a central location. This makes backup and version control of configurations easily achievable Changes to all servers propagate through the entire infrastructure within a couple of minutes, without having to log in to any machine directly Everything is described in the same language, making it easy to configure new software Modules are similar to libraries and allow configurations to be consolidated.</description>
