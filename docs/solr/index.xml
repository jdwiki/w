      <description>When searching against the target of a copyField instructions, the analyzer stack used is the one of the copyField target, not source. This is especially important to remember with default configuration that searches against generic text field.
Has my content actually indexed? # Often people try to index some content and then find it. If they cannot see the expected result, they try to troubleshoot the whole end-to-end process. The better way is to see whether the content actually indexed in the expected fields.</description>

      <description>This documentation provides a way to connect to hive using SOLR Data Import Handler and index the data in SOLR. This is an interesting documentation because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it over internet.
The handler basically handles more than 80 million records which means a strong infrastructure with good CPUs and Memory is definitely needed.
Please feel free to reach out to us and we will try to help as much as possible.</description>
