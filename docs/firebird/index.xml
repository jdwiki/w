      <description>With Firebird 2.1 and databases with ODS 11.1 (and higher) Firebird introduces the ability to monitor server-side activity happening inside a particular database.
Complete database monitoring is available to SYSDBA and the database owner. Regular users are restricted to the information about their own attachments onlyâ€”other attachments are invisible to them.
Available monitoring tables since Firebird 2.1 and ODS 11.1:
MON$DATABASE (connected database) MON$ATTACHMENTS (connected attachments) MON$TRANSACTIONS (started transactions) MON$STATEMENTS (prepared statements) MON$CALL_STACK (call stack of active PSQL requests) MON$IO_STATS (I/O statistics) MON$RECORD_STATS (record-level statistics) Reference: Firebird 2.</description>
