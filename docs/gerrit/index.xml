      <description>Merging straight to master # If you want to make a change that you want to merge with master, the best way is to first create a topic branch
git checkout -b foo make a single commit with your feature
git commit -m &amp;quot;Made the thing X finally work&amp;quot; and push that branch to review via
git push origin foo:refs/for/master/foo Avoid working directly on master, as you will have problems resolving conflicts if someone else pushed to master before you.</description>
