      <description>Sections are a feature that allow store owners to add, edit, remove and easily reorder content on a page. There are 2 types of sections: dynamic and fixed. Dynamic sections are able to be reordered in their entirety with other sections on the page (homepage). Fixed sections cannot be reordered, but the content within them can still be added to, edited, removed and reordered.
Things to remember: # The schema of a section is scoped to that particular section.</description>
