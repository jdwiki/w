      <description>A bounded context is subset of a large domain model. In larger domains, multiple teams will be working on multiple areas of the solution and this strategic pattern helps to share the work among the teams. The idea is to divide the big domain model in more focused areas, giving the team the freedom to solve each subset of the domain in the best way, even, with totally independent code, database and services.</description>
