      <description>Variants # There are many different variants of the ARM architecture and implementations that have evolved over time. The notation can be confusing. For instance, arm7 and armv7, are completely different. The first is a CPU implementation; the second is a CPU architecture. The architecture, also called a family, is a set of machine instructions (or ISA for instruction set architecture) that are generally compatible. See: Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s list of ARM microarchitectures for more.</description>
