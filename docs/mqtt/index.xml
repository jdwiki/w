      <description>Introduction # MQTT(Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a Publish-Subscribe based &amp;ldquo;lightweight&amp;rdquo; messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP stack.
It is quite useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
There are many different Brokers and Clients that implement the MQTT protocol.
A list of Brokers, Clients and Tools can be found on the mqtt.org website here, while it is not definitive it does offer a representative sample.</description>

      <description>The protocol runs over TCP/IP, or over other network protocols that provide ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections.
Simple public/subscribe model in MQTT # Its key features include:
Use of the publish/subscribe message pattern which provides one-to-many message distribution and decoupling of applications.
A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload. Three qualities of service for message delivery
A small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimized to reduce network tra</description>

      <description>Example of publish/subscriber in java # create Dynamic web project in sts/eclipse download the eclipse paho jar from click here to download and paste jar file in webcontent-&amp;gt;webinf-&amp;gt;folder-&amp;gt;lib
Publish Example
String broker = &amp;quot;tcp://localhost:1883&amp;quot;; String topicName = &amp;quot;test/topic&amp;quot;; int qos = 1; MqttClient mqttClient = new MqttClient(broker,String.valueOf(System.nanoTime())); //Mqtt ConnectOptions is used to set the additional features to mqtt message MqttConnectOptions connOpts = new MqttConnectOptions(); connOpts.setCleanSession(true); //no persistent session connOpts.setKeepAliveInterval(1000); MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(&amp;quot;Ed Sheeran&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>To implement MQTT
We need MQTT Broker, and MQTT client Library
MQTT Libraries &amp;amp; MQTT Broker # To use MQTT in the application we have variety of Libraries available for different programming languages.
MQTT Library
LIBRARY LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION Eclipse Paho C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Go, C# Paho clients are among the most popular client library implementations. Fusesource MQTT Client Java The Fusesource MQTT client is a Java MQTT client with 3 different API styles: Blocking, Future-based, and Callback-based.</description>
