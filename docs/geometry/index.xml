      <description>Questions to ask yourself # When investigating some geometric problem, there are a number of questions you might want to ask yourself to narrow down the scope of the question.
How many dimensions are you dealing with? Is it 2d, 3d, a specific number of higher dimensions, or without respect to dimensionality? In case of a 2d geometry, is it planar geometry, or is it e.g. spherical geometry, as one would encounter when dealing with geographic coordinates?</description>

      <description>A geometric line is a straight line that extends to infinity in both directions. This distinguishes it from the segment or the ray, which end et some point, and also from the curve or polygon, which need not be straight.
There are different ways how a line may be presented. Each comes with its own benefits and drawbacks.
