      <description>Database Transaction Units (DTU) are the unit in which the performance of Azure SQL DB is measured. DTUs make the most sense when used for comparing workloads. For example, a workload that uses 5 DTUs will consume 10 DTUs when doubled.
Officialy, Microsoft has introduced the DTU as the average number of realistic transactions that can be executed per second. Investigating workloads shows that the percentage of DTU used is defined as the MAX of the percentage of CPU, Log I/O and Data I/O used.</description>
