      <description>Editing the hosts file # The easiest way to connect via curl to a different server is to alter the hosts file on your machine.
On Linux and Unix systems, the hosts file is located in /etc/hosts, while on Windows systems it will be located in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts.
Once you open the file with a text editor of your choice, add
1.2.3.4 domain.tld www.domain.tld
This is basically the IP of the server you would like to resolve the domain to followed by the domain and a www version of the domain.</description>
