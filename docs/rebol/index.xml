      <description>Installation or Setup # Detailed instructions on getting rebol set up or installed.
The most mature and stable version of Rebol is the official Rebol2, available from the downloads page for multiple platforms. There are 2 flavors:
Rebol/View (version with gui, ~ 0.6 MB) Rebol/Core (no gui, for servers, ~ 0.3 MB) The version with gui (Rebol/View) is recommended for newcomers as it is also a super-set of Rebol/Core
As the download page states, Rebol requires no installation.</description>

      <description>Series are the core of how Rebol works and as such understanding how to manipulate series is fundamental in mastering the language. There are two series subtypesâ€”blocks and strings: both share essential common traits with regard to traversal, alteration and extraction, though all series have subtle differences that affect how they are interpreted.
