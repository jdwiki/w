      <description>RelayCommand # The RelayCommand implements the ICommand interface and can therefore be used to bind to Commands in XAML (as the Command property of the Button element)
The constructor takes two arguments; the first is an Action which will be executed if ICommand.Execute is called (e.g. the user clicks on the button), the second one is a Func&amp;lt;bool&amp;gt; which determines if the action can be executed (defaults to true, called canExecute in the following paragraph).</description>
