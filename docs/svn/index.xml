      <description>Committing your local changes to the repository # To publish the changes you made in your working copy, run the svn commit command.
IMPORTANT: Review your changes before committing them! Use svn status and svn diff to review the changes. Also, make sure you are in the correct path before performing a commit. If you updated many files across various directories, you should be at the appropriate level to include all of them beneath your location.</description>

      <description>Syntax # svn copy [BRANCH-FROM-URL] [BRANCH-TO-URL] -m &amp;lt;COMMIT-LOG-MESSAGE&amp;gt;
svn copy [^/PATH-TO-BRANCH-FROM] [^/PATH-TO-BRANCH-TO] -m &amp;lt;COMMIT-LOG-MESSAGE&amp;gt;
As you might have noticed, we use svn copy command to create branches, tags and shelves (we&amp;rsquo;ll skip mentioning tags and shelves in the next paragraphs). This is the same command used to copy items in your working copy and into the repository.
svn copy is used for branching because, branch is technically a copy of the source you copy from.</description>
