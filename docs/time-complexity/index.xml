      <description>Installation or Setup # Time complexity is a property of
Problems someone might want to solve computationally, Algorithms designed to solve such problems and Programs implementing such algorithms. An abstract concept requires no installation or setup. Simply take any problem, algorithm, or code and ask &amp;ldquo;How long will this take?”
Hello, world! # echo &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot; Even in bash, this program works similarly in most other languages. The program has no input and will always function the same in an idealized world - run time should never change.</description>

      <description>All five classes in the Landau system describe asymptotic behaviour, i.e. the behaviour when the size of the problem tends to infinity. While this might look irrelevant to our – very finite – real world problems, experience has shown that behaviour of real world algorithms mirrors this infinite behaviour well enough on real data to be of practical use.
Big O # Big O notation provides upper bounds for the growth of functions.</description>
