      <description>Understanding the DICOM File Format # The DICOM Image file is a tagged image file; the file contains both an image (most of the time) and a collection of data about the image. The data in a DICOM image file is stored as a sequence of individual elements. Each element contains one item of information about the image or the image itself. DICOM elements are binary, so DICOM files cannot be viewed with a text editor.</description>
