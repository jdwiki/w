      <description>Fancy url to php script # In this example, we rewrite url&amp;rsquo;s of the form http://example.com/topic/id-seoname to a php script that takes an id as input. This example expects the rule to be in [&amp;ldquo;per-directory&amp;rdquo; context](https://www.wikiod.com/mod-rewrite/contexts-of-rewrite-rules#Rewrite rules in per-directory context).
RewriteEngine on RewriteRule ^topic/([0-9]+)-[^/]*/?$ /topics.php?id=$1 [L] In this example, topic/ is the common prefix of all topics. It is followed by a number that is used by the script. Lastly, the seo name is displayed.</description>

      <title>Contexts of rewrite rules</title>
      <link>https://www.wikiod.com/mod-rewrite/contexts-of-rewrite-rules/</link>

      <description>This topic describes the two contexts in which RewriteRule can be used. In examples omitting RewriteEngine on, it is assumed this directive has occured before that example.
Rewrite rules in per-directory context # The per-directory context is a part of the static configuration file between &amp;lt;Directory&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt; tags. The entire content of dynamic configuration files is within the per-directory context of the folder in which the .htaccess resides.
RewriteRule&amp;rsquo;s in per-directory context match against the part of an url after the protocol, hostname, port and prefix of the directory in which they reside, and before the query string.</description>
