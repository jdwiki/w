      <description>Different methods and their arguments are used to achieve the wished behaviour of your telegram bot, which you created by now (hopefully).
The basic structure of a query is (as mentioned in &amp;ldquo;Create a bot with the BotFather&amp;rdquo;): https://api.telegram.org/bot*BOTTOKEN*/*METHOD*?*ARGUMENT1*=*VALUE1*&amp;amp;*ARGUMENT2*=*VALUE2* You will use this structure with as many arguments you need/ want and this documentation will show you the basic methods and how to use them.
SendMessage method # https://api.telegram.org/bot*BOTTOKEN*/sendmessage?chat_id=exampleID&amp;amp;text=exampleText&amp;amp;parse_mode=HTML

      <description>There are two methods to get messages and informations from your bot:
The /getUpdates function wich is documented pretty straight forward in the spectific section of the documentation
Next: The webhook function which is a bit more complex and often causes issues.
The difference basically is that you use the first alternative to pull changes and react to them and the second one acts more like a push method, by sending a json document.</description>
