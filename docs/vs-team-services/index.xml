      <description>Getting started # Visual Studio Team Services is an hosted version of Microsoft Team Foundation Server. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any installation as it&amp;rsquo;s already done by Microsoft itself.
In order to start using Visual Studio Team Services you need to create an account here by pressing the Free account button. It will redirect you to the login page. Use a Microsoft account or, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one, create it.</description>

      <description>A hub in VSTS is a section grouping the features based on similar functionality e.g. Code, Build etc. VSTS comes with a capability where we can extend the hubs by adding more functionalities related to current hub, making the hub more usable for the given scenario or requirement of functionality.
Snake (Game) # This extension adds a game named snake in the VSTS, which users can play while waiting for the long running build for example.</description>
