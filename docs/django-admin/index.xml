      <description>Remove a Model from Admin pages # Django Admin comes with some Models registerd by default. There a some occasions where you might want to remove a Model from the admin pages.
This is done in the admin submodule. If your app wass created using manage.py startapp, the admin.py file should already lay in your app module. Otherwise create it.
#myapp/admin.py from django.contrib import admin from django.contrib.auth.models import User admin.site.unregister(User) Setup Django Admin # Everything you need to get started with Django admin is already setup in Django&amp;rsquo;s default project layout.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need get_price(self) specially when you are not making any changes to the price variable. I would remove the method get_price since you can get the same value from the price under the product model. I could be wrong. Just don&amp;rsquo;t see the value of get_price method here.
Product discount action # One day I had a conversation with a friend of mine who uses Laravel PHP framework in his job.</description>
