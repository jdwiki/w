      <description>What is Postman? # Postman is an API Development Environment that helps people to build, test, document, monitor and publish documentation for their APIs.
The main features of Postman are
Sending requests (with support for different authentication schemes, Cookies, certificates, headers, query parameters, request body and SOAP with/without WSDL) and debugging and saving responses. Organizing your APIs into groups called as Collections. Sharing and collaborating your Collections with your team. Writing tests.</description>
