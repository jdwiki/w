      <description>About Documentation # What can be documented?
Examples of functions for various languages. A brief introduction of each tag. What is the difference between a question and a topic?
Topics have a broader scope than questions; documentation topics that are asked as a question can be closed because they are too broad. Topics should have multiple examples; a request that can be served by a topic with a single example (e.</description>

      <description>Topics organize Examples into an easily digestible page. They should be self-contained and written for the benefit of the reader in a hurry.
Anatomy of a Topic # A topic is made up of several sections:
Title: What is the subject of the topic. Search existing topics first to make sure you are not repeating content that already exists. Topics already covered elsewhere on Stack Overflow may be deleted.
Versions: The versions where the material covered by the topic applies.</description>

      <description>How to write a good example? # Example is the main part of Documentation, it is thus important to provide clear and useful examples.
Good examples are self-contained and succinct. Examples usually would have code for users to understand the topic better.
Refer to the Help Center for more information.
How can I move an example to another tag? # Click the “Move examples” button Select the examples you want to move Click “Move” Select “Search for a Topic” Paste the URL of the topic in the search box Click “Move Examples”.</description>

      <description>Version Table # Every tag has an overview topic. This topic has a special section named &amp;ldquo;Versions&amp;rdquo;. In that section, different versions can be defined in a table that has that should
have at least 2 columns:
the first one should be the name of the version
the last one should be the release date of the version, by which versions will be ordered.
It should be in the yyyy-MM-dd format and a valid date.</description>

      <description>Pinned example # One example per topic may be pinned by clicking the pin icon in the bottom left corner of the example. So long as a topic is pinned, it will stay at the top of a topic&amp;rsquo;s example collection.
Votes # Aside from pinned examples, it is not possible to enforce the order of examples. Instead, order is naturally selected in descending order of total votes. The most popular example will therefore bubble to the top of the collection of examples.</description>

      <description>Linebreaks # Automatic Linebreaks # Table content is line wrapped automatically if it is too wide. In the following example, text is added to the second column, which causes oth the text itself and the column header of the first column to be wrapped.
| this is a really wide column header | another header | | --- | --- | | | | this is a really wide column header another header | this is a really wide column header | another header | | --- | --- | | | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit, sed eiusmod tempor incidunt ut labore et dolore magn | this is a really wide column header another header Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit, sed eiusmod tempor incidunt ut labore et dolore magn Manual Linebreaks # It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to insert manual breaks as you would in regular text.</description>

      <description>Topics should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. This one suggests some organizing principles seen on Stack Overflow Documentation.
Language feature Topics # A natural division is simply to make one topic for each language feature. For instance, Python has:
Classes Functions Generators Decorators . . . On the downside, features can be quite complicated and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to come up with many more examples than make sense for a single page.</description>
