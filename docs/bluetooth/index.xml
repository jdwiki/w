      <description>Profiles # The Bluetooth specification contains several profile specifications. A profile describes how to use and implement a function.
They can depend on each other, here is a basic layout of the most common profile dependencies
All profiles can be found at BT SIG, be aware that different versions might contain different functionality. Also note that some of the profiles contains several categories, these are sometimes optional, so make sure that your device supports the category in question.</description>

      <description>Connecting to BLE Slave Devices # Introduction # Texas Instruments&amp;rsquo; (TI) CC26XX series SoCs are readily available wireless MCUs targeting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications. Along with the MCUs, TI offers a full-fledged software stack that provides necessary API and sample codes to help quickly get developers started with the tool chain. However, for beginners, there is always the question of where to start in front of a long list of reference document and codes.</description>

      <description>In C, with Bluez # int get_l2cap_connection () { First off, all the variables we need, explanation for will follow at the appropriate spot.
int ssock = 0; int csock = 0; int reuse_addr = 1; struct sockaddr_l2 src_addr; struct bt_security bt_sec; int result = 0; First, we need to create a socket, that we can accept a connection from. The socket family is PF_BLUETOOTH, socket type is SOCK_SEQPACKET (we want to have a TCP-like socket, not raw), and the protocol is the Bluetooth protocol L2CAP (BTPROTO_L2CAP).</description>

      <title>Get Started With Bluetooth LE on Windows</title>

      <description>Documentation
Advertisement - A representation of a Bluetooth LE advertisement payload. Advertisement Publisher - Manages the sending of Bluetooth LE advertisements. Advertisement Watcher - Manages the watching of Bluetooth LE advertisements. Notes
Windows 10 can only act in central mode, so it can only connect to devices that support peripheral mode. Due to this, two Windows 10 devices cannot connect over Bluetooth LE. Windows 10 must be paired with a Bluetooth LE device in order to connect to it.</description>
